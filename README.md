This project, titled "Applied Statistical Inference and Experimental Design," examines the factors influencing departure delays for United Airlines flights. The analysis uses two datasets from the 

nycflights13 package: flights and weather. The main goal is to understand the relationship between departure delays and various factors, including time of day, time of year, temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and visibility. The findings aim to provide United Airlines with actionable insights to improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.




This report is designed for a non-technical audience, focusing on the practical implications of the findings. The analysis uses the 

mean departure delay as a reference point to make the data more comparable and meaningful.



Analysis Overview
The analysis explores the following key areas:


Departure Delays by Time of Day: Flights during the night hours were found to have slightly longer delays compared to other times of the day.



Departure Delays by Time of Year: Flights in the fall and winter seasons tend to experience longer delays than those in the spring and summer.


Departure Delays by Temperature: There is a significant association between temperature and departure delays. Flights in colder temperatures generally experience longer delays than those in warmer temperatures.



Departure Delays by Wind Speed: The analysis showed a modest relationship between wind speed and delays, with slightly longer delays on windy days.






Departure Delays by Precipitation: Precipitation, specifically in the 0.45-0.60 interval, is correlated with longer departure delays.



Departure Delays by Visibility: Poor visibility conditions were found to be associated with longer departure delays.


Recommendations for United Airlines
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided to United Airlines:


Schedule Adjustments: Modify flight schedules to account for periods with historically longer delays, such as night hours or the fall and winter seasons.






Operational Preparedness: Increase preparedness for adverse weather, including streamlined de-icing procedures, especially during cold and winter months.






Resource Allocation: Ensure that staff and ground operations are optimized for busy periods and challenging weather conditions.






Technology and Maintenance: Invest in technologies that can enhance visibility and ensure that equipment, particularly de-icing vehicles, is well-maintained for operations in various weather conditions.






Passenger Communication: Proactively inform passengers about potential delays due to weather or other factors and offer flexible rebooking options.





The ultimate goal of these recommendations is to enhance the overall travel experience by fostering more punctual and reliable flight services.
